# Dotfiles

## Setting preferences

**For macOS only.** If you haven't installed Xcode or command line tools yet, use
`xcode-select --install` to download and install them, or check the Apple developer site. And only
after installing the developer tools, it will execute the following the command in the directory
with the **dotfiles** project:

```bash
make install
```

**Note:** On macOS Catalina, the default interactive shell is now zsh. To update your account to use
bash, please run `chsh-s/bin/bash`. For more For details, please

### Optional, install oh-my-zsh

Use the command from the official site [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Installing software (software)

### Install macOS dependencies

Homebrew must be installed to correctly install the software for macOS use the command from the
official site [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Software installation

You can install the software using the scripts described in the **scripts** directory, for
software installation on macOS using the brew tool, for Linux standard package managers with the
addition of third-party repositories. To start the installation, execute the following the command
in the directory with the **dotfiles** project:

```bash
make install-software
```

Running this command can lead to the execution of irreversible actions on your system, since fully
clean the system from the installed software with the ability to reliably determine what exactly was
installed by the command and which intermediate files might not have been created seems possible.

## Undo changes

Automated rollback of changes is not provided, you can try to manually analyze changes made to the
system or will be restored from a backup copy if you have one.
